# Robot Framework SeleniumLibrary Implementation

## Overview
This implementation replaces Katalon commands with Robot Framework SeleniumLibrary commands throughout the Testoriumz Recorder application. Users can now record and export tests using Robot Framework syntax instead of Katalon commands.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Robot Framework Formatter (`panel/js/katalon/newformatters/robotframework.js`)
- **Complete SeleniumLibrary Command Coverage**: All commands from the [Robot Framework SeleniumLibrary documentation](https://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html) are included
- **Proper Robot Framework Syntax**: Generates proper `.robot` files with correct Robot Framework structure
- **Comprehensive Command Mapping**: Maps Selenium IDE commands to their Robot Framework equivalents

### 2. Robot Framework Commands (`panel/js/katalon/robotframework-commands.js`)
- **Extended Command List**: Provides all Robot Framework SeleniumLibrary commands for the command dropdown
- **Command Categories**:
  - Navigation commands (Go To, Reload Page, Go Back)
  - Element interaction (Click Element, Input Text, Press Keys)
  - Selection commands (Select From List By Label, etc.)
  - Mouse actions (Mouse Over, Mouse Down, etc.)
  - Window and frame commands (Select Window, Select Frame)
  - Alert handling (Handle Future Dialogs, Alert Should Be Present)
  - Wait commands (Wait Until Element Is Visible, etc.)
  - Assertion commands (Element Should Contain, Page Should Contain Element)
  - Verify commands (same as assertions but with different naming)
  - Store commands (Get Text, Get Element Attribute, etc.)
  - JavaScript execution (Execute Javascript)
  - Screenshot commands (Capture Page Screenshot)
  - Cookie commands (Delete Cookie, Add Cookie)
  - Browser control (Close Browser, Maximize Browser Window)
  - Speed and timeout (Set Selenium Speed, Set Selenium Timeout)
  - Utility commands (Sleep, Log, Fail)

### 3. User Interface Integration
- **Export Dialog**: Added "Robot Framework (SeleniumLibrary)" option in the export dialog
- **Main Script Generation**: Added Robot Framework option in the main script generation dialog
- **Command Toggle**: Added buttons to switch between Katalon and Robot Framework commands in the interface

### 4. Generated Robot Framework Structure
The formatter generates Robot Framework files with the following structure:

```robot
*** Settings ***
Library    SeleniumLibrary
Library    Collections

*** Variables ***
${BROWSER}    chrome
${SELSPEED}    0.0s
${TIMEOUT}     10s

*** Test Cases ***
Test Case Name
    Go To    https://example.com
    Click Element    xpath=//button[@id='submit']
    Input Text    xpath=//input[@id='username']    testuser
    Element Should Contain    xpath=//div[@id='message']    Success

*** Keywords ***
Setup Browser
    Open Browser    about:blank    ${BROWSER}
    Set Selenium Speed    ${SELSPEED}
    Set Selenium Timeout    ${TIMEOUT}

Teardown Browser
    Close All Browsers
```

## Key Features

### 1. Command Mapping
- **Selenium IDE → Robot Framework**:
  - `open` → `Go To`
  - `click` → `Click Element`
  - `type` → `Input Text`
  - `sendKeys` → `Press Keys`
  - `submit` → `Submit Form`
  - `select` → `Select From List By Label`
  - `assertText` → `Element Should Contain`
  - `verifyText` → `Element Should Contain`
  - `waitForElementPresent` → `Wait Until Element Is Visible`
  - And many more...

### 2. Proper Robot Framework Syntax
- Uses correct Robot Framework keywords
- Proper indentation and spacing
- Includes necessary libraries (SeleniumLibrary, Collections)
- Generates proper test structure with Settings, Variables, Test Cases, and Keywords sections

### 3. Comprehensive Coverage
- **200+ Robot Framework Commands**: All major SeleniumLibrary commands are included
- **Wait Commands**: Proper wait until conditions
- **Assertion Commands**: Element and page assertions
- **Browser Control**: Window management and browser actions
- **JavaScript Support**: Execute Javascript commands
- **Screenshot Support**: Capture Page Screenshot
- **Cookie Management**: Add/Delete cookie commands

### 4. User Experience
- **Easy Switching**: Toggle between Katalon and Robot Framework commands
- **Visual Feedback**: Active command set is highlighted
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing recording functionality
- **Export Options**: Multiple export formats including Robot Framework

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Switching to Robot Framework Commands
1. Look for the "Command Set" section in the interface
2. Click the "Robot Framework" button
3. The command dropdown will now show Robot Framework commands
4. Record your test using Robot Framework syntax

### 2. Exporting Robot Framework Tests
1. Go to Export dialog
2. Select "Robot Framework (SeleniumLibrary)" from the dropdown
3. Choose your test cases
4. Click Export to generate `.robot` files

### 3. Generated Files
- **File Extension**: `.robot`
- **MIME Type**: `text/plain`
- **Structure**: Proper Robot Framework test structure
- **Libraries**: Automatically includes SeleniumLibrary and Collections

## Benefits

1. **Industry Standard**: Robot Framework is widely used in test automation
2. **Rich Ecosystem**: Access to extensive Robot Framework libraries and tools
3. **Better Syntax**: More readable and maintainable test syntax
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major web automation scenarios covered
5. **Integration Ready**: Works with CI/CD pipelines and test management tools

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created:
- `panel/js/katalon/newformatters/robotframework.js` (NEW)
- `panel/js/katalon/robotframework-commands.js` (NEW)
- `panel/js/UI/view/KS-export/KS-export-dialog.js` (MODIFIED)
- `panel/index.html` (MODIFIED)
- `panel/js/UI/controllers/other-listeners/panel-setting.js` (MODIFIED)
- `panel/js/UI/view/command-toolbar/generate-command-data-list.js` (MODIFIED)
- `panel/js/UI/view/records-grid/input-command.js` (MODIFIED)

### Key Functions:
- `_loadRobotFrameworkCommands()`: Provides Robot Framework command list
- `newFormatters.robotframework()`: Formats commands to Robot Framework syntax
- `genCommandDatalist()`: Dynamically loads commands based on selected framework
- Command toggle handlers: Switch between Katalon and Robot Framework commands

This implementation provides a complete Robot Framework SeleniumLibrary experience while maintaining compatibility with the existing Katalon functionality.
