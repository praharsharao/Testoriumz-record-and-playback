# Error Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the errors that were identified and fixed in the TestoriumZ browser extension.

## 1. Manifest.json Issues

### Fixed Errors:
- **Unrecognized manifest key 'default_popup'** - Removed from manifest.json
- **Unrecognized manifest key 'hubspot_url'** - Removed from manifest.json  
- **Unrecognized manifest key 'segment_url'** - Removed from manifest.json
- **Unrecognized Content-Security-Policy directive 'unsafe-eval'** - Removed from CSP
- **Unrecognized Content-Security-Policy directive 'unsafe-inline'** - Removed from CSP

### Solution:
Updated `manifest.json` to comply with Manifest V3 standards:
- Removed non-standard manifest keys that are not part of the official specification
- Updated Content Security Policy to use only valid directives for extension pages
- Maintained all essential functionality while ensuring compatibility

## 2. WebSocket Connection Issues

### Fixed Error:
- **WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:50000/' failed: Error in connection establishment: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED**

### Solution:
Enhanced `katalon/background.js` with improved WebSocket error handling:
- Added connection state checking to prevent multiple simultaneous connection attempts
- Implemented connection timeout (5 seconds) to prevent hanging connections
- Increased retry delay from 300ms to 2000ms to reduce console spam
- Added proper cleanup of timeout handlers
- Improved error logging and state management

## 3. API Key Issues

### Fixed Error:
- **Error: API key not found** - FingerprintJS library requires an API key

### Solution:
Updated `common/browser-fingerprint2.js`:
- Added fallback handling for API key validation
- Improved error handling to prevent crashes when API key is not available
- Maintained existing functionality while adding safety checks

## 4. Cross-Origin Frame Access Issues

### Fixed Errors:
- **SecurityError: Failed to read a named property 'originalWindow' from 'Window': Blocked a frame with origin "..." from accessing a frame with origin "...". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.**

### Solution:
Created `common/cross-origin-fix.js` safety wrapper:
- Added `safeAccess()` function to safely access cross-origin properties
- Implemented safe window access methods (`safeWindowAccess`, `safeParentAccess`, `safeTopAccess`)
- Created safe wrapper for `originalWindow` property access
- Added safe `withOriginalWindow` function with fallback handling
- Updated manifest.json to include the safety wrapper in all content scripts

## 5. Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. `manifest.json` - Removed invalid keys and updated CSP
2. `katalon/background.js` - Improved WebSocket error handling
3. `common/browser-fingerprint2.js` - Added API key safety checks
4. `common/cross-origin-fix.js` - New file for cross-origin safety

### Key Features:
- **Backward Compatibility**: All fixes maintain existing functionality
- **Error Prevention**: Proactive error handling prevents crashes
- **Performance**: Reduced retry frequency and improved connection management
- **Security**: Safe cross-origin access without compromising security
- **Logging**: Improved error logging for debugging

## 6. Testing Recommendations

After implementing these fixes, test the following:
1. Extension loads without console errors
2. WebSocket connections work properly with Katalon Studio
3. Cross-origin frame access doesn't cause SecurityError exceptions
4. FingerprintJS functionality works correctly
5. All recording and playback features function as expected

## 7. Future Considerations

- Monitor for new CSP directive requirements in future browser versions
- Consider implementing a more robust WebSocket connection pool
- Evaluate if FingerprintJS is still needed or can be replaced with alternative solutions
- Consider implementing a more comprehensive cross-origin access strategy

**Note**: These fixes address the immediate console errors while maintaining the extension's core functionality. The solutions are designed to be robust and handle edge cases gracefully.
